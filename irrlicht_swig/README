irrlicht_swig - is a SWIG python wraper for the Irrlicht Engine SDK version 1.7.1 (https://irrlicht.sourceforge.io). See 'HelloWorld.py' for an example of a Python script accessing and controlling Irrlicht. 
This project is such as "pyrr", but compatible with last Irrlicht engine and more compatible with C++ style.

The Irrlicht Engine is intended to be an easy-to-use 3d engine.
