irrlicht_swig - is a SWIG python wraper for the Irrlicht Engine SDK version 1.7.1 (http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net). See 'HelloWorld.py' for an example of a Python script accessing and controlling Irrlicht. 
This project is such as "pyrr", but compatible with last Irrlicht engine and more compatible with C++ style.

The Irrlicht Engine is intended to be an easy-to-use 3d engine.
If you have any questions or suggestions, just send a email to the author of the engine, Nikolaus Gebhardt (niko (at) irrlicht3d.org).

If you have any questions or suggestions concerning pyirrlicht, send a email to the lead Developer, Max Kolosov (maxkolosov (at) inbox.ru).
