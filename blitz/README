Irrlicht wrapper for Blitz Basic.
Main idea by Atulos,
also hi is main helper and tester,
many thanks him.
Programming by Maxim Kolosov.

This based on irrlicht_c library from pyirrlicht project

Blitz3D work only with stdcall calling convention,
so irrlicht_c must be build respectively.

Models and textures (like *.md2, *.bmp)
can be get from official Irrlicht SDK.
